# Setup

There are many ways to get started with Scala and we will suggest that you try Scala CLI, developed by VirtusLab.
Also, we recommend VS Code with the Metals extension for your IDE.
With those two tools, you will be able to run, compile and develop your code.

Of course, if you have already Scala installed, you can skip this part. You can come back to
this documentation anytime if you want to try this setup.

## Install Scala CLI

> Scala CLI combines all the features you need to learn and use Scala in your scripts,
> playgrounds and (single-module) projects.

import BasicInstall from "../../../website/src/components/BasicInstall.js"

## Install VS Code and Metals


> Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight code editor created by Microsoft.
> It supports an incredible number of languages through its extension system.
>
> Its more popular extension for Scala is called Metals.
> We will use VS Code and Metals to write and navigate Scala code.
