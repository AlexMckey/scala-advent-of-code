# Setup

There are many ways to get started with Scala and we are going to try a new one in this documentation.
It relies on Scala-cli, a new tool developed by VirtusLab, and then VScode with metals as an IDE.
With those two tools, you will be able to run, compile and develop your code.

Of course, if you have already Scala installed, you can skip this part. You can come back to 
this documentation anytime if you want to try this setup.

## Install Scala-Cli 

> Scala CLI combines all the features you need to learn and use Scala in your scripts, 
> playgrounds and (single-module) projects.

import BasicInstall from "../../../website/src/components/BasicInstall.js"

<BasicInstall/>

:::tip Prefer another way to install Scala CLI?
See VirtusLab [Advanced installation guide](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install#advanced-installation).

## Install VScode and Metals


> Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight code editor created by Microsoft.
> It supports an incredible number of languages through its extension system.
> 
> Its more popular extension for Scala is called Metals.
> We will use VS Code and Metals to write and navigate Scala code.

### VS code
Download the right VScode for your operating system on 
[the download page of VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and then install it.
